# LASER WEED INCISOR SAFETY DOCUMENTATION

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING ⚠️

**CLASS 4 LASER PRODUCT - INVISIBLE LASER RADIATION**
**AVOID EYE OR SKIN EXPOSURE TO DIRECT OR SCATTERED RADIATION**

This system uses a **5W 450nm blue diode laser** for precision weed control. Improper use can cause **permanent eye damage or blindness**.

## MANDATORY SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- **CERTIFIED LASER SAFETY GLASSES** with OD rating for 440-460nm wavelength
- Never rely on glasses provided with laser modules - use certified equipment only
- Protective clothing to prevent skin exposure
- Safety glasses must be worn by ALL personnel in the operational area

### 2. Operational Safety Zone
- **5-meter minimum operator distance** during laser operation
- **2-meter laser safety zone** around targeting area must be clear
- Post warning signs around operational perimeter
- Ensure no reflective surfaces in the beam path

### 3. Pre-Operation Safety Checklist
- [ ] All personnel wearing certified laser safety glasses
- [ ] Safety zone cleared of people, animals, and reflective objects
- [ ] Emergency stop system tested and functional
- [ ] Laser power settings verified (default 80% max power)
- [ ] Environmental conditions within safe limits
- [ ] Safety confirmation given by designated safety officer

### 4. Emergency Procedures
- **Emergency stop button** immediately disables all laser output
- **Kill switch** cuts power to entire system
- First aid procedures for laser exposure posted and understood
- Emergency contact information readily available

## SYSTEM SAFETY FEATURES

### Hardware Safety Interlocks
- Automatic power shutdown on safety violations
- Thermal monitoring with automatic cutoff
- Proximity sensors to detect zone intrusions
- Fail-safe design - system defaults to "off" state

### Software Safety Features
- Continuous safety monitoring at 10Hz
- Maximum firing time limits (500ms max continuous)
- Mandatory cooldown periods (1000ms minimum)
- Multi-level safety confirmation required
- Automatic emergency stop on detected violations

### Operational Limits
- Maximum continuous operation: 500ms
- Minimum cooldown between operations: 1000ms
- Maximum ambient temperature: 50°C
- Maximum laser module temperature: 70°C
- Maximum wind speed: 5 m/s

## WEED TARGETING SPECIFICATIONS

### Laser Parameters
- **Wavelength**: 450nm (blue laser)
- **Power**: 5W maximum (typically 80% = 4W)
- **Beam diameter**: 2.5mm at focus
- **Exposure time**: 200ms per weed
- **Targeting precision**: ±1mm

### Target Selection Criteria
- Minimum detection confidence: 70%
- Maximum target size: 5000 pixels
- Only targets grass marked as "needs cutting"
- Integrates with existing grass detection system

## INTEGRATION WITH LAWN CARE SYSTEM
